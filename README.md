In this repository, we are trialing some of the earlier implementations of Seq2Seq models. Our main focus is on the Transformer architecture, not the RNN types. The two are often confused when searching online for help.

The main goal is to understand the complete encoder-decoder architecture in relation to NLP and to become comfortable with integrating these models into the Hugging Face repository.
